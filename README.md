# REDXJS

## Project Goals

* Better understand Redux core ideas 
* Build a library with Typescript
* Get better at Rxjs and programming reactively
* Get better at programming 


## Future
Might publish to npm in the future if it becomes nontrivial to implement the features on a project by project basis with vanillajs. I've published packages to npm in the past that are a bit embarassing.
